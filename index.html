		<h2>About Me</h2>
	    <img src="assets/images/Selfie.jpg">
	    <p>I am 28 years old, born in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon but grew up in Hermosillo, Sonora. I have had the opportunity to live in four countries: Mexico, Canda, France and USA. I studied International Business at ITESM in Hermosillo, and then worked for 3 years at Heineken Mexico in the Logistics and Customer Service Department.</p>
        <p>Sadly, due to a corporate downsizing I was let go of my job. While I was job searching, I saw an add for this coding bootcamp. Now I seek to learn coding in order to change my career. Even though I didn't study anything related to computers or software, I'm always the IT guy for my family so I decided to embrace the role. I'm also a gamer, mostly on PC, so I know my way around a computer. Now that I have chosen to study coding, it would be a dream come true if this change of career could eventually get me into the gaming industry.</p>
