    <header>About Me</header>
    <p>I am 28 years old, born in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon but grew up in Hermosillo, Sonora. I studied International Business at ITESM in Hermosillo, and then worked for 3 years at Heineken Mexico in the Logistics and Customer Service Department.</p>
    <p>Now I seek to learn coding in order to change my career. Ever since I was a child, I have loved videogames so it would be a dream come true if a career in coding could one day get me into the videogame industry.</p>
